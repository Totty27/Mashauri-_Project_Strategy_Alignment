## Company Background 

Mashauri is a UK-based digital platform that supports universities, students and small, upcoming business entrepreneures in launching ventures through structured acceleration programs. Its goal is to embed entrepreneurial learning within academic ecosystems globally. As it expands into emerging markets, including Africa, Mashauri must refine its offerings, improve learner outcomes, and optimize partnerships with universities.

## Problem Statement

Mashauri have assigned me as a Business Analyst to support their expansion into South Africa and other similar emerging education ecosystems, using public information, competitor insights, and simulated scenarios.

## Project Overview and Objectives

The goal of this project is to assess Mashauri's business Model, process design, performance frameworks, and finally recommend improvements for scaling impact sustainably in regions like Southern Africa.

This will be achieved by completing the following objectives:

- Identifying strategic pathways for global expansion and localization, particulary in emerging education and entrepreneurial ecosystems.
- Refine the current virtual accelleration model by incorporating insights from global best practices and region-specific needs.
- Improve user engagement and platform adoption by evaluating customer journeys and operational angagement.
- Develop a strategic roadmap that positions Mashauri as a globally recognized, scalable, and inclusive virtual accelerator platform.
